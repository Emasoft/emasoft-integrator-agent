## Synchronization Protocol

### Real-Time Triggers

| Event | Source | Status Update |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Issue assigned | GitHub | Check if Todo |
| Branch created | GitHub | → In Progress |
| PR opened | GitHub | → In Review |
| PR merged | GitHub | → Done |
| PR closed without merge | GitHub | → In Progress |
| Label "blocked" added | GitHub | → Blocked |
| Label "blocked" removed | GitHub | → Previous status |

### Periodic Sync (Every 30 minutes)

```
FOR each project item:
  1. GET current GitHub issue state
  2. GET current project status
  3. IF state mismatch:
     - DETERMINE correct status based on:
       - Issue open/closed
       - PR exists/merged
       - Labels present
       - Agent activity
     - UPDATE project status
     - LOG sync action
```

### Conflict Resolution

When GitHub state and project status conflict:

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Issue closed, status not Done | Set to Done |
| PR merged, status In Review | Set to Done |
| No activity 24h, status In Progress | Query agent, consider Blocked |
| Agent reports complete, status not In Review | Verify PR, update accordingly |
