## Using Templates via CLI

### Create Issue from Template

```bash
# Feature request
gh issue create \
  --title "Add OAuth2 support" \
  --template "feature_request.yml" \
  --label "type:feature,priority:high"

# Bug report
gh issue create \
  --title "Login fails with special chars" \
  --template "bug_report.yml" \
  --label "type:bug,priority:critical"
```

### Create Issue with Full Body

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Implement User Registration" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## User Story
As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Registration form with email, password, name
- [ ] Email validation
- [ ] Password strength requirements
- [ ] Confirmation email sent
- [ ] Redirect to login after registration

## Technical Notes
- Use existing EmailService for sending confirmation
- Store password hash with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- JWT token in confirmation link (24h expiry)

## Out of Scope
- Social registration (OAuth) - separate feature
- Admin approval workflow
