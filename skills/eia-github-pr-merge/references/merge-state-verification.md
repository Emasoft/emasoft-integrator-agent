## 1.1 Why `gh pr view --json state` Can Be Stale

### 1.1.1 REST API Caching Behavior

The GitHub REST API (which `gh pr view` uses) employs aggressive caching for performance reasons. This means:

1. **Response caching**: GitHub caches REST API responses for varying durations
2. **ETags and conditional requests**: Even with fresh requests, the underlying data may be cached at GitHub's infrastructure layer
3. **Eventual consistency**: After a merge operation, the REST API may continue returning `OPEN` state for several seconds

**Example of stale data:**

```bash
# This can return state="OPEN" even after PR is merged
gh pr view 123 --repo owner/repo --json state
# Output: {"state":"OPEN"}  # STALE!

# Meanwhile, the PR is actually merged in GitHub's database
```

### 1.1.2 Race Conditions in Merge State

Race conditions occur when:

1. **Concurrent operations**: Multiple actors (humans, bots) operating on the same PR
2. **CI completion timing**: Status checks completing at the moment of merge attempt
3. **Review submission**: Approvals being added while merge is in progress
4. **Branch updates**: Base branch receiving commits during merge

The REST API cannot guarantee atomicity in these scenarios. Only GraphQL with the right queries provides the real-time state.

## 1.2 GraphQL as the Source of Truth

### 1.2.1 GraphQL Query for Merge State

The authoritative query for PR merge state:

```graphql
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      id
      number
      title
      state
      merged
      mergedAt
      mergeCommit {
        oid
        messageHeadline
      }
      mergeable
      mergeStateStatus
      autoMergeRequest {
        enabledAt
        mergeMethod
      }
      reviewDecision
      commits(last: 1) {
        nodes {
          commit {
            statusCheckRollup {
              state
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Execute with gh CLI:**

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $number) {
        state
        merged
        mergedAt
        mergeCommit { oid }
        mergeable
        mergeStateStatus
      }
    }
  }
' -f owner="owner" -f repo="repo" -F number=123
```

### 1.2.2 Interpreting MergeStateStatus Values

The `mergeStateStatus` field is the definitive indicator of whether a PR can be merged. The `state` field alone is insufficient - it only tells you OPEN/CLOSED/MERGED at a high level.

**Key fields to check:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `state` | Enum | OPEN, CLOSED, or MERGED |
| `merged` | Boolean | True if PR has been merged |
| `mergedAt` | DateTime | Timestamp of merge (null if not merged) |
| `mergeCommit.oid` | String | SHA of merge commit (null if not merged) |
| `mergeable` | Enum | MERGEABLE, CONFLICTING, or UNKNOWN |
| `mergeStateStatus` | Enum | Detailed merge eligibility status |

**Decision logic:**

```python
# Check if PR is merged
if data["merged"] == True and data["mergeCommit"]["oid"]:
    # PR is definitely merged, mergeCommit.oid is the merge SHA
    pass

# Check if PR can be merged now
if data["mergeStateStatus"] == "MERGEABLE":
    # Safe to merge
    pass
elif data["mergeStateStatus"] == "UNKNOWN":
    # Retry after short delay
    pass
else:
    # Cannot merge - check specific status for reason
    pass
```

## 1.3 MergeStateStatus Values Explained

### 1.3.1 MERGEABLE - Safe to Merge

**Meaning**: The PR can be merged right now. All requirements are satisfied.

**What this guarantees:**
- No merge conflicts exist
- All required status checks have passed
- All required reviews are approved
- Branch protection rules are satisfied

**Action**: Proceed with merge operation.

### 1.3.2 CONFLICTING - Conflicts Exist

**Meaning**: The PR has merge conflicts that must be resolved before merging.

**Causes:**
- Files modified in both the PR branch and base branch
- File deletions in one branch, modifications in another
- Rename conflicts

**Action**:
1. Update PR branch with base branch changes
2. Resolve conflicts locally
3. Push resolved changes
4. Wait for new status check

### 1.3.3 UNKNOWN - State Being Computed

**Meaning**: GitHub is calculating the merge state. This is temporary.

**When this occurs:**
- Immediately after PR creation
- After pushing new commits
- After base branch changes
- During high API load periods

**Action**: Wait 5-10 seconds and retry the query. Implement exponential backoff:

```python
import time

def wait_for_merge_state(max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        state = get_merge_state_status()
        if state != "UNKNOWN":
            return state
        time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds
    raise TimeoutError("Merge state still UNKNOWN after retries")
```

### 1.3.4 BLOCKED - Branch Protection Rules Blocking

**Meaning**: Branch protection rules prevent the merge.

**Common causes:**
- Required status checks not passing
- Required number of approvals not met
- CODEOWNERS review not approved
- Required conversation resolution not met
- Administrator override required

**Action**: Check specific blocking requirements:

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "owner", name: "repo") {
    pullRequest(number: 123) {
      mergeStateStatus
      reviewDecision
      commits(last: 1) {
        nodes {
          commit {
            statusCheckRollup {
              state
              contexts(first: 50) {
                nodes {
                  ... on CheckRun {
                    name
                    conclusion
                  }
                  ... on StatusContext {
                    context
                    state
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 1.3.5 BEHIND - Branch Needs Update

**Meaning**: The PR branch is behind the base branch and must be updated before merge.

**When this occurs:**
- Branch protection requires "up to date before merge"
- Base branch has received new commits

**Action**:
1. Update PR branch: `gh pr update-branch 123`
2. Or merge base into PR branch locally
3. Wait for status checks to complete

### 1.3.6 DIRTY - Merge Commit Cannot Be Cleanly Created

**Meaning**: GitHub cannot create a clean merge commit.

**Causes:**
- Complex merge conflicts
- Submodule issues
- Git history problems

**Action**: Manual intervention required:
1. Checkout PR branch locally
2. Merge base branch manually
3. Resolve all issues
4. Force push updated branch

### 1.3.7 UNSTABLE - Failing Required Status Checks

**Meaning**: One or more required status checks are failing.

**Note**: This is different from BLOCKED - UNSTABLE specifically indicates status check failures, while BLOCKED can be any branch protection rule.

**Action**:
1. Query status checks to identify failures
2. Fix failing checks
3. Push updates or re-run workflows

## 1.4 Pre-Merge Verification Checklist

### 1.4.1 Required Checks Before Merge

Always verify these conditions before attempting a merge:

1. **PR is not already merged**
   ```python
   assert data["merged"] == False
   assert data["state"] == "OPEN"
   ```

2. **No merge conflicts**
   ```python
   assert data["mergeable"] != "CONFLICTING"
   ```

3. **Merge state is determined**
   ```python
   assert data["mergeStateStatus"] != "UNKNOWN"
   ```

4. **PR is mergeable**
   ```python
   assert data["mergeStateStatus"] == "MERGEABLE"
   ```

5. **CI status is acceptable** (if not ignoring CI)
   ```python
   ci_state = data["commits"]["nodes"][0]["commit"]["statusCheckRollup"]["state"]
   assert ci_state == "SUCCESS"
   ```

6. **Review decision is acceptable** (if reviews required)
   ```python
   # APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, REVIEW_REQUIRED, or null
   assert data["reviewDecision"] in ["APPROVED", None]
   ```

### 1.4.2 Verification Script Usage

Use the provided `eia_test_pr_merge_ready.py` script:

```bash
# Full verification
python scripts/eia_test_pr_merge_ready.py --pr 123 --repo owner/repo

# JSON output explains any blocking reasons:
# {
#   "ready": false,
#   "blocking_reasons": [
#     {"code": "CI_FAILING", "message": "Required status check 'tests' is failing"},
#     {"code": "REVIEW_REQUIRED", "message": "Waiting for required review approval"}
#   ],
#   "merge_state_status": "BLOCKED",
#   "mergeable": "MERGEABLE"
# }
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0`: Ready to merge
- `1`: CI failing
- `2`: Conflicts exist
- `3`: Unresolved threads
- `4`: Reviews required/changes requested

The script automatically handles UNKNOWN state with retries, so you don't need to implement retry logic in your automation.
