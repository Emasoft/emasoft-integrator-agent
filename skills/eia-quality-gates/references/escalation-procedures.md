## Overview

When quality gates fail and issues are not resolved through normal channels, systematic escalation ensures problems are addressed by the appropriate authority.

---

## Escalation Path A: Pre-Review Gate Failure

**Trigger**: Automated checks (tests, linting, build) fail

### Level 1: Author Notification

**Timeline**: Immediate upon gate failure
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Template**:
```
❌ Pre-review gate failed:

**Failures**:

**Template**:
```
⏰ Pre-review gate failure follow-up

PR has been blocked for 24 hours due to failing checks.

**Status**: Awaiting fixes from @author

**Impact**: Review process cannot begin until checks pass.

Please provide status update or address failures.
```

Original review issues remain unresolved.

**Outstanding Issues**:
- [Issues not yet addressed]

**Status**: Awaiting changes from @author

Please address feedback or discuss if clarification needed.
```

**Success Criteria**: Author makes meaningful progress on issues

### Level 3: Orchestrator Escalation

**Action**: Notify EOA
**Timeline**: 1 week after Level 2 (configurable)
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Trigger**: No meaningful progress on review feedback

**Notification**:
```
@eoa - Review gate escalation

PR #${PR_NUMBER} blocked for 1+ week due to unresolved review issues.

**Author**: @author
**Issues**: [Summary of blocking issues]
**History**: Request changes submitted, one follow-up, minimal progress

**Request**: Mediation or PR disposition decision
```

**Outcome Options**:
- EOA mediates between reviewer and author
- EOA provides guidance on resolving issues
- PR marked for closure if abandoned

### Level 4: Consider Closure

**Action**: Close PR with explanation
**Timeline**: 2 weeks after Level 3 (configurable)
**Responsible**: EOA or Maintainer

**Trigger**: No path forward after EOA engagement

**Closure Template**:
```
Closing due to unresolved review issues.

**Reason**: Review feedback not addressed after multiple attempts to engage.

**History**:
- Review requested changes: [date]
- Follow-up: [date]
- EOA escalation: [date]
- No resolution achieved

Author is welcome to reopen or submit fresh PR if issues are addressed.
```

## Escalation Path C: Pre-Merge Gate Failure

**Trigger**: Final checks fail (CI, conflicts, stale approval)

### Level 1: Automatic Block + Comment

**Action**: Block merge, comment with failure
**Timeline**: Immediate upon gate failure
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Template**:
```
❌ Pre-merge gate failed - merge blocked

**Failures**:
- [CI status]
- [Merge conflict status]
- [Approval validity status]

**Required Actions**:
- [What must be fixed]

Merge will be unblocked when all checks pass.

cc @author
```

**Success Criteria**: Author resolves issues

### Level 2: Author Notification

**Action**: Direct notification to resolve
**Timeline**: 24 hours after Level 1 (configurable)
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Trigger**: No action after initial block

**Template**:
```
⏰ Pre-merge gate failure - action required

PR remains blocked for 24 hours.

**Issue**: [Specific blocker]
**Impact**: Cannot merge until resolved

Please [specific action - rebase, fix CI, etc.].
```

**Success Criteria**: Author takes action

### Level 3: Orchestrator Escalation

**Action**: Notify EOA for investigation
**Timeline**: If CI infrastructure issue suspected
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Trigger**: Persistent CI failure unrelated to PR code

**Notification**:
```
@eoa - Pre-merge gate CI infrastructure issue

PR #${PR_NUMBER} blocked by CI failures that appear infrastructure-related.

**Evidence**:
- [Describe why infrastructure is suspected]
- [CI logs showing infra errors]

**Request**: Infrastructure investigation
```

**Outcome**: EOA investigates CI infrastructure, resolves issue or confirms code problem

## Escalation Path D: Post-Merge Gate Failure

### Level 1: Immediate Notification (All Parties)

**Action**: Notify author, reviewer, and EOA simultaneously
**Timeline**: Immediate upon detection
**Responsible**: EIA Integrator Agent

**Template**:
```
🚨 **POST-MERGE GATE FAILED** 🚨

Main branch health check failed after merging PR #${PR_NUMBER}.

## Override Authority During Escalation

At any escalation level, authorized parties can override the gate:

| Escalation Level | Who Can Override |
|------------------|------------------|
| Level 1-2 | Senior Reviewer (non-security only) |
| Level 3 | EOA or Maintainer |
| Level 4 | Maintainer only |

**Security issues**: No override at any level.

See [override-examples.md](./override-examples.md) for override documentation examples.

---

## Notification Channels

Escalations use multiple channels for reliability:

1. **PR Comments** - Primary (always)
2. **GitHub @mentions** - Secondary (always)
3. **Email** - Tertiary (for urgent escalations)
4. **Slack/Discord** - Optional (if configured)
5. **AI Maestro Messages** - Optional (for agent-to-agent coordination)

Configure channels in repository settings.
