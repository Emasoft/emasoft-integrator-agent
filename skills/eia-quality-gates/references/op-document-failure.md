### CI Check Failures

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Tests | FAILED | 3 tests failing in `test_auth.py` |
| Lint | FAILED | 5 linting errors |
| Build | PASSED | - |

### Test Failures
```

### Critical Issues

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (Security)
   - Location: `src/db/queries.py:42`
   - Issue: User input concatenated into SQL query
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries
   ```python
   # Bad
   query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

   # Good
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
   cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
   ```
```
