# Release Management Skill

## Overview

This skill defines the **release management procedures** for coordinating software releases across patch, minor, and major version changes.

Release management is the final gate before code reaches production. It requires systematic verification, proper versioning, comprehensive documentation, and reliable rollback procedures.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
2. Repository has proper access permissions for releases
3. Python 3.8+ for running helper scripts
4. Semantic versioning is followed in the project
5. CI/CD pipeline is configured and operational

## Output

| Output Type | Format | Contents |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Release Verification Report | Markdown | Pre-release checklist results, pass/fail status, blocking issues |
| Changelog | Markdown | Categorized list of changes since last release |
| Release Notes | Markdown | User-facing summary of changes, highlights, migration notes |
| Version Bump Confirmation | JSON | Old version, new version, files modified |
| Release Tag | Git tag | Annotated tag with version and release notes summary |
| Rollback Report | Markdown | Rollback steps taken, verification of rollback success |

## Instructions

1. **Receive release request** - From EOA or user, including target release type
2. **Determine version number** - Based on change scope (see Section 2: Release Types)
3. **Verify release readiness** - Run pre-release verification checklist (see Section 5)
4. **Generate changelog** - Compile changes since last release (see Section 4.2)
5. **Create release notes** - Write user-facing summary (see Section 4.3)
6. **Bump version** - Update version in all required files (see Section 4.1)
7. **Create release tag** - Tag commit with version and annotation (see Section 4.4)
8. **Trigger CI/CD** - Run release pipeline (see Section 8)
9. **Verify post-release** - Confirm release deployed correctly (see Section 6)
10. **Report completion** - Notify requesting agent of release status

|         +--> Migration guide required
|         +--> Breaking changes documented
|         +--> User notification required
|
+--> Pre-release verification passes?
|    +--> YES --> Proceed to release
|    +--> NO --> Identify blocking issues
|              +--> Critical issues --> STOP, escalate to user
|              +--> Non-critical --> Document and proceed (with approval)
|
+--> Release deployed successfully?
     +--> YES --> Create release notes, notify stakeholders
     +--> NO --> Initiate rollback (see Section 7)

## Semantic Versioning Quick Reference

| Change Type | Version Increment | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Bug fix (no API change) | PATCH | 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 |
| New feature (backward compatible) | MINOR | 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0 |
| Breaking change | MAJOR | 1.2.3 -> 2.0.0 |
| Pre-release alpha | PATCH + suffix | 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4-alpha.1 |
| Pre-release beta | PATCH + suffix | 1.2.4-alpha.1 -> 1.2.4-beta.1 |
| Release candidate | PATCH + suffix | 1.2.4-beta.1 -> 1.2.4-rc.1 |

---

## State-Based Verification Model

### Release Readiness States

Instead of time-based checks, use state-based transitions:

```
UNVERIFIED
    |
    v
VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS
    |
    +--> All gates pass --> READY_FOR_RELEASE
    |
    +--> Any gate fails --> BLOCKED
                             |
                             v
                        Identify blocker type
                             |
                             +--> Critical --> ESCALATE_TO_USER
                             +--> Non-critical --> DOCUMENT_AND_AWAIT_APPROVAL
```

### Escalation Order

When verification fails, follow this escalation order:

| Order | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Test failure | Delegate fix to implementation agent, await resolution |
| 2 | Critical bug open | Escalate to user for release decision |
| 3 | Missing documentation | Delegate documentation task, await completion |
| 4 | Dependency vulnerability | Escalate to user with severity assessment |
| 5 | CI/CD failure | Investigate cause, escalate if infrastructure issue |

## Critical Rules Summary

### Rule 1: Never Release Without Approval
The release coordinator must NEVER publish a release without explicit user approval. Always present verification results and await decision.

### Rule 2: Verify Before and After
Always run pre-release verification before starting release process. Always run post-release verification after deployment completes.

### Rule 3: Document Everything
Every release must have:
- Updated changelog
- Release notes
- Version bump in all files
- Annotated git tag

### Rule 4: Be Ready to Rollback
Always have a rollback plan before releasing. Know exactly how to revert if issues arise.

### Rule 5: Follow Semantic Versioning
Version numbers communicate meaning. Never use incorrect version increments.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Patch Release

```bash
# 1. Verify release readiness
python scripts/eia_release_verify.py --repo owner/repo --version 1.2.4

# 2. Generate changelog
python scripts/eia_changelog_generate.py --repo owner/repo --from v1.2.3 --to HEAD

# 3. Bump version
python scripts/eia_version_bump.py --repo owner/repo --type patch

# 4. Create release (after user approval)
python scripts/eia_create_release.py --repo owner/repo --version 1.2.4 --notes release_notes.md
```

### Example 2: Major Release with Breaking Changes

```bash
# 1. Verify release readiness (includes migration guide check)
python scripts/eia_release_verify.py --repo owner/repo --version 2.0.0 --type major

# 2. Generate comprehensive changelog
python scripts/eia_changelog_generate.py --repo owner/repo --from v1.9.0 --to HEAD --include-breaking

# 3. Bump version
python scripts/eia_version_bump.py --repo owner/repo --type major

# 4. Create release with migration notes
python scripts/eia_create_release.py --repo owner/repo --version 2.0.0 --notes release_notes.md --prerelease false
```

### Example 3: Rollback After Failed Release

```bash
# 1. Execute rollback
python scripts/eia_rollback.py --repo owner/repo --from v1.2.4 --to v1.2.3 --reason "Critical regression in API"

# 2. Verify rollback success
python scripts/eia_release_verify.py --repo owner/repo --version 1.2.3 --mode verify-deployed
```

## Error Handling

### Issue: Pre-release verification fails
**Cause**: One or more quality gates not passing
**Solution**: Identify failing gates from verification report, delegate fixes to appropriate agent, await resolution before proceeding

### Issue: Version bump conflicts
**Cause**: Version already bumped in another branch or manual edit
**Solution**: Check current version across all files, resolve conflicts, ensure consistency before proceeding

### Issue: Tag already exists
**Cause**: Tag was created previously (possibly from failed release)
**Solution**: Verify tag points to correct commit. If incorrect, delete tag and recreate. If correct, skip tag creation.

### Issue: CI/CD pipeline fails during release
**Cause**: Infrastructure issue, test failure, or configuration problem
**Solution**: Check pipeline logs, identify failure stage, address root cause, re-trigger pipeline

### Issue: Post-release deployment not detected
**Cause**: Deployment delay, monitoring misconfiguration, or actual failure
**Solution**: Check deployment logs, verify package registry, run manual smoke tests, escalate if issue persists

### Issue: Rollback cannot be completed
**Cause**: Package registry restrictions, deployment system issues
**Solution**: Document manual rollback steps, escalate to user, consider publishing hotfix version instead
