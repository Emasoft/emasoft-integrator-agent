## 5.1 Transition Matrix

```
FROM ↓ / TO →    │ Backlog │ Todo │ In Progress │ AI Review │ Human Review │ Merge/Release │ Done │ Blocked │

```

**Legend:**
- ✓ = Valid transition
- ✗ = Invalid transition
- `-` = Same status (no transition)

**Task Routing Rules:**
- **Small tasks**: In Progress → AI Review → Merge/Release → Done (skip Human Review)
- **Big tasks**: In Progress → AI Review → Human Review → Merge/Release → Done
- The Integrator agent (EIA) reviews ALL tasks in AI Review
- Only BIG tasks go to Human Review (user reviews via EAMA Assistant Manager)
- Any status can move to Blocked (and back)

---

| Todo → In Progress | Assignee set, no blocking dependencies |
| In Progress → AI Review | PR created, tests passing, PR linked to issue |
| AI Review → Human Review | Integrator approved, task flagged as BIG |
| AI Review → Merge/Release | Integrator approved, task is SMALL (no human review needed) |
| Human Review → Merge/Release | Human approved the changes |
| Merge/Release → Done | PR merged, CI passed |
| Any → Blocked | Blocker documented with reason |
| Blocked → Previous | Blocker resolved, documented in comment |

## 5.3 Who Can Move

### Permission Matrix

| Transition | Orchestrator | Integrator | Assigned Agent | Any Agent | Human/User | Automatic |
|------------|--------------|------------|----------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Backlog → Todo | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Todo → Backlog | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Todo → In Progress | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| In Progress → Todo | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| In Progress → AI Review | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| AI Review → In Progress | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| AI Review → Human Review | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| AI Review → Merge/Release | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Human Review → In Progress | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Human Review → Merge/Release | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Merge/Release → Done | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (PR merge) |
| Any → Blocked | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Blocked → Previous | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

### Key Rules

1. **Only orchestrator moves from Backlog** - Prioritization control
2. **Assigned agent moves In Progress → AI Review** - Author submits for review
3. **Only Integrator moves from AI Review** - Integrator decides routing (Human Review for big, Merge/Release for small)
4. **Only Human/User moves from Human Review** - User has final say on big tasks
5. **Anyone can block** - Safety first
6. **Done is automatic** - PR merge triggers

## 5.6a AI Review to Human Review

### When to Transition

Move from AI Review to Human Review when:
- Integrator agent (EIA) has reviewed and approved the code changes
- The task is flagged as BIG (requires human review)

This transition applies ONLY to big tasks. Small tasks skip Human Review and go directly to Merge/Release (see section 5.6b).

### Preconditions Checklist

1. EAMA (Assistant Manager) notifies the user that a big task needs human review
2. PR link and summary are included in the notification
3. Review request is recorded on the PR

### Comment Template

```markdown
AI Review complete. Routing to Human Review (big task).
Integrator review: Approved.
@user please review PR #123.
```

---

## 5.6b AI Review to Merge/Release

### When to Transition

Move from AI Review to Merge/Release when:
- Integrator agent (EIA) has reviewed and approved the code changes
- The task is SMALL (does not require human review)

This is the fast path for small tasks that do not need human approval.

### Preconditions Checklist

- [ ] Integrator review is complete
- [ ] Task has `size:small` label or no size label (defaults to small)
- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No blocking issues found by Integrator

### Who Can Move

Only the **Integrator agent (EIA)** can move cards from AI Review to Merge/Release. No other agent or automation has this permission.

### Postconditions

After moving to Merge/Release:
1. PR is marked as ready to merge
2. CI pipeline must pass before merge can proceed

### Comment Template

```markdown
AI Review complete. Small task approved. Ready to merge.
Integrator review: Approved.
PR #123 is ready for merge.
```

---

## 5.6c Human Review to Merge/Release

### When to Transition

Move from Human Review to Merge/Release when:

- User gives explicit approval on the PR or issue

### Preconditions Checklist

- [ ] Human has reviewed the PR
- [ ] Human has given explicit approval (PR approval or comment)
- [ ] No outstanding human review comments

### Who Can Move

2. PR is marked as ready to merge
3. CI pipeline must pass before merge can proceed

### Comment Template

```markdown

```

---

## 5.7 Merge/Release to Done

### When to Transition

Move from Merge/Release to Done when:
- PR is merged (not just approved)
- This transition should be AUTOMATIC via GitHub

### Automatic Trigger

When PR body contains "Closes #N" and PR is merged:
1. GitHub closes issue #N automatically
2. Board should reflect Done status

### Manual Transition (Exceptional)

If automatic transition fails:

```bash
# Check PR is actually merged
gh pr view 123 --json merged

# If merged but issue not closed, close manually
gh issue close 42

# Update board status
# [GraphQL mutation to set status to Done]
```

### Verification

Before marking Done, verify:
- [ ] PR is actually merged (not just closed)
- [ ] CI checks passed
- [ ] No follow-up issues created

---

## 5.8 Any to Blocked

### When to Transition

Move to Blocked when:
- External dependency is preventing progress
- Agent cannot proceed without intervention
- Resource or access is unavailable

### What Constitutes a Blocker

| Blocker Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Technical | Dependency not available |
| Access | Missing permissions |
| Clarification | Requirements unclear |
| External | Third-party API down |
| Resource | Server not provisioned |

### Required Information

When moving to Blocked, MUST provide:

```markdown
## Blocked

**Blocker:** [description]
**Type:** Technical / Access / Clarification / External / Resource
**Blocking Issue:** #XX (if applicable)
**What's Needed:** [specific action to unblock]
**Impact:** [what can't proceed]
**Discovered:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Update status to Blocked
# [GraphQL mutation]

# Add blocked label
gh issue edit 42 --add-label "blocked"

# Comment with blocker details
gh issue comment 42 --body "## Blocked
**Blocker:** Missing database credentials
**Type:** Access
**What's Needed:** DBA to provide staging DB credentials
**Discovered:** 2024-01-15 15:00 UTC"
```

---

## 5.9 Blocked to Previous

### When to Transition

Move from Blocked back to previous status when:
- Blocker is resolved
- Agent can continue work
- Resolution is verified

### Determining Previous Status

Track the status before blocking in the blocker comment:

```markdown
## Blocked

**Previous Status:** In Progress
[... blocker details ...]
```

### Resolution Process

1. Verify blocker is actually resolved
2. Document resolution in comment
3. Remove "blocked" label
4. Update status to previous (usually In Progress)
5. Notify agent to resume

### Resolution Comment Template

```markdown
## Unblocked

**Resolution:** Database credentials received from DBA
**Resolved:** 2024-01-15 18:00 UTC
**Next Action:** Resume implementation

Returning to **In Progress**.
```

## 5.10 Invalid Transitions

### Invalid Transition Attempts

| Attempted | Why Invalid | What to Do |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Backlog → In Progress | Skips Todo | Move to Todo first |
| Todo → AI Review | Skips In Progress | Move to In Progress first, create PR |
| In Progress → Human Review | Skips AI Review | Must go through AI Review first |
| In Progress → Merge/Release | Skips review | Must go through AI Review (and optionally Human Review) |
| In Progress → Done | Skips review and merge | Must go through full review pipeline |
| AI Review → Done | Skips Merge/Release | Must go through Merge/Release |
| Human Review → Done | Skips Merge/Release | Must go through Merge/Release |
| Done → Any | Done is terminal | Create new issue if more work needed |

### Handling Invalid Requests

If an agent requests an invalid transition:

1. **Reject the request**
2. **Explain why it's invalid**
3. **Suggest correct path**

Example response:
```
Cannot move directly from Todo to AI Review.
The correct path is:
1. Todo → In Progress (start work, create branch)
2. In Progress → AI Review (create PR, submit for review)

Please move to In Progress first.
```

### Script: Validate Transition

```python
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    "Backlog": ["Todo"],
    "Todo": ["Backlog", "In Progress", "Blocked"],
    "In Progress": ["Todo", "AI Review", "Blocked"],
    "AI Review": ["In Progress", "Human Review", "Merge/Release", "Blocked"],
    "Human Review": ["In Progress", "Merge/Release", "Blocked"],
    "Merge/Release": ["Done", "Blocked"],
    "Done": [],  # Terminal
    "Blocked": ["Todo", "In Progress"],
}

def is_valid_transition(from_status, to_status):
    return to_status in VALID_TRANSITIONS.get(from_status, [])
```
