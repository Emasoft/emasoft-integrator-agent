## 2.1 Overview

The EOA orchestration workflow uses exactly 8 columns. Each column has a precise meaning, requirements, and rules about who can move items into it.

```
┌──────────┬──────────┬────────────┬───────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Backlog  │   Todo   │In Progress │ AI Review │ Human Review │ Merge/Release │   Done   │ Blocked  │
├──────────┼──────────┼────────────┼───────────┼──────────────┼───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤

└──────────┴──────────┴────────────┴───────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

**Flow:** Backlog -> Todo -> In Progress -> AI Review -> Human Review (big tasks) / Merge/Release (small tasks) -> Done

**Special:** Any status can move to Blocked (and back)
