# GitHub Kanban Core

## THE IRON RULE

**GitHub Projects Kanban IS the orchestration state. There is no other source of truth.**

- Every module = 1 GitHub Issue on the board
- Every agent assignment = 1 Issue assignee
- Every status change = 1 board column move
- The orchestrator NEVER tracks work in memory, files, or any other system

If it's not on the board, it doesn't exist. If the board says "In Progress", it IS in progress.

---

## Overview

This skill establishes GitHub Projects V2 as the absolute center of EOA orchestration workflow. All planning, tracking, assignment, and completion verification flows through the Kanban board.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:
1. GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
2. GitHub Projects V2 is enabled for the repository
3. GraphQL API access is available
4. Python 3.8+ for running board management scripts

## Instructions

Follow these steps when using GitHub Kanban as the orchestration source of truth:

1. **Initialize board access** - Verify GitHub CLI authentication and Projects V2 access
2. **Query current state** - Use `kanban_get_board_state.py` to see all items and their columns
3. **Create module issues** - For new work, create GitHub Issues following the issue-to-module mapping (see references/issue-to-module-mapping.md)
4. **Assign work** - Set issue assignees to designate responsible agents (see references/agent-assignment-via-board.md)
5. **Track transitions** - Move cards between columns as work progresses (see references/status-transitions.md)
6. **Handle blockers** - Mark items as Blocked with reason when cannot proceed (see references/blocking-workflow.md)
7. **Verify completion** - Before exit, use `kanban_check_completion.py` to ensure all items are Done

### Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Verify GitHub CLI authentication: `gh auth status`
- [ ] Verify Projects V2 access for the repository
- [ ] Query current board state: `python3 scripts/kanban_get_board_state.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER`
- [ ] Create module issues for new work (1 issue = 1 module)
- [ ] Add issues to project board in Backlog column
- [ ] Move ready issues from Backlog to Todo
- [ ] Assign issues to responsible agents (issue assignee = agent)
- [ ] Agent moves issue to In Progress when starting work
- [ ] Agent creates PR linked to issue, moves to In Review
- [ ] Track card transitions using: `python3 scripts/kanban_move_card.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER ISSUE_NUMBER NEW_STATUS`
- [ ] Handle any blockers: move to Blocked column with `--reason` flag
- [ ] Resolve blockers and move back to previous status
- [ ] Verify completion before exit: `python3 scripts/kanban_check_completion.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER`
- [ ] Ensure exit code is 0 (all items Done) before exiting

### When to Use This Skill

Read this skill when:
- Starting any orchestration session
- Planning new work (modules, features, tasks)
- Assigning work to agents or humans
- Checking work status or progress
- Verifying completion before exiting
- Handling blocked work items

Move a card to a different column with validation.

```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_move_card.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER ISSUE_NUMBER NEW_STATUS [--reason "Reason"]
```

**Validates:** Transition is allowed, preconditions met.

---

### Check Completion ([scripts/kanban_check_completion.py](scripts/kanban_check_completion.py))

Check if all board items are complete (for stop hook).

```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_check_completion.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER
```

**Exit codes:**
- 0: All items Done
- 1: Items still in progress
- 2: Blocked items exist

---

## Integration Points

### Planning Phase

1. Orchestrator breaks work into modules
2. Each module becomes a GitHub Issue
3. Issues are added to project board in Backlog
4. Orchestrator moves ready issues to Todo
5. Board reflects complete work breakdown

### Orchestration Phase

1. Orchestrator assigns Todo issues to agents
2. Agent moves issue to In Progress when starting
3. Agent creates PR, moves to In Review
4. PR merge auto-moves to Done
5. Board reflects real-time progress

### Stop Hook Phase

1. Stop hook queries board state
2. Checks: all assigned items Done or explicitly deferred
3. If incomplete items exist, prevents exit
4. Orchestrator must resolve or defer before exit

### Assignment Flow

1. Orchestrator identifies next Todo item
2. Orchestrator assigns to available agent
3. Assignment appears as GitHub issue assignee
4. Agent receives notification via AI Maestro
5. Assignment visible on board

### PR Completion Flow

1. Agent creates PR linked to issue (Closes #N)
2. Agent moves issue to In Review
3. Review happens (AI or human)
4. PR merged triggers auto-move to Done
5. Issue closes automatically

## Examples

### Example 1: Get Current Board State

```bash
# Get full board state with all items
python3 scripts/kanban_get_board_state.py owner repo 1

# Output: JSON with items grouped by status column (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, etc.)
```

### Example 2: Move Card and Check Completion

```bash
# Move issue #42 to In Progress
python3 scripts/kanban_move_card.py owner repo 1 42 in_progress --reason "Starting work"

# Check if all items are complete (for stop hook)
python3 scripts/kanban_check_completion.py owner repo 1
# Exit code 0 = all done, 1 = items pending, 2 = blocked items exist
```

## Output

| Output Type | Format | Description | When Generated |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Board State JSON** | JSON object | All items grouped by status column | Via `kanban_get_board_state.py` |
| **Transition Result** | JSON object | Success/failure of card move with validation | Via `kanban_move_card.py` |
| **Completion Status** | Exit code + JSON | 0=all done, 1=pending, 2=blocked | Via `kanban_check_completion.py` |
| **Assignment Notification** | AI Maestro message | Agent receives work assignment | When issue assigned |
| **GraphQL Query Results** | JSON object | Raw board data from GitHub API | Via reference queries |
| **Blocker Report** | JSON object | All blocked items with reasons | When querying blocked items |

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Issue not appearing on board** | Issue not added to Projects V2, wrong project number | Verify project link with `gh issue view <N>`, re-add to project |
| **Status change not reflecting** | Invalid transition, missing permissions | Check transition matrix in references/status-transitions.md, verify GitHub permissions |
| **Assignment not showing** | Issue not on board, invalid assignee username | Ensure issue is on project board, use correct GitHub username |
| **GraphQL API rate limit** | Too many rapid queries | Wait 60 seconds, use query caching, reduce polling frequency |
| **Permission denied** | Insufficient GitHub permissions | Verify `gh auth status`, ensure write access to repository and project |
| **Board state out of sync** | Stale cache, concurrent modifications | Force refresh with fresh GraphQL query, avoid caching board state |
| **Stop hook blocking exit** | Items not in Done column | Complete pending items, move to Done, or defer with explicit reason |
| **Corrupted board state** | Manual edits outside workflow | Use recovery procedure in references/troubleshooting.md section 10.8 |

## Proactive Kanban Monitoring

### Overview

The orchestrator must PROACTIVELY monitor the GitHub Project Kanban board for changes, rather than waiting for events. This ensures timely response to card movements, status changes, and assignment updates.

### Polling Configuration

**Poll Frequency**: Every 5 minutes during active orchestration sessions.

**Polling Command**:
```bash
# Get all items from the project board
gh project item-list --owner Emasoft --format json
```

### What to Check on Each Poll

| Check | Command | Action When Detected |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Card movements | Compare `status` field with previous poll | Notify relevant agent of status change |
| New assignees | Compare `assignees` field | Welcome new assignee, provide context |
| Due date changes | Compare `dueDate` field | Alert if due date approaches or passes |
| New items added | Check for new `id` values | Add to backlog, notify orchestrator |
| Items removed | Check for missing `id` values | Log removal, update internal state |

### Polling Script

```bash
# Poll and detect changes (run every 5 minutes)
python scripts/kanban_poll_changes.py --owner Emasoft --project PROJECT_NUMBER --interval 300
```

### Change Detection Logic

```python
# Pseudocode for change detection
previous_state = load_previous_state()
current_state = gh_project_item_list()

for item in current_state:
    if item.id not in previous_state:
        notify("New item added", item)
    elif item.status != previous_state[item.id].status:
        notify("Card moved", item, previous_state[item.id].status, item.status)
    elif item.assignees != previous_state[item.id].assignees:
        notify("Assignment changed", item)

save_state(current_state)
```

### AI Maestro Notifications

When changes are detected, notify relevant agents:

```bash
# Notify agent of assignment
curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "TARGET_AGENT",
    "subject": "Kanban Update: Issue #123 assigned to you",
    "priority": "normal",
    "content": {
      "type": "kanban-assignment",
      "message": "Issue #123 has been assigned to you. Current status: Todo. Please move to In Progress when starting."
    }
  }'

# Notify orchestrator of status change
curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "orchestrator-eoa",
    "subject": "Kanban Update: Issue #123 moved to In Review",
    "priority": "normal",
    "content": {
      "type": "kanban-status-change",
      "message": "Issue #123 moved from In Progress to In Review by agent-name. PR likely created."
    }
  }'
```

### Proactive Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Set up polling script to run every 5 minutes
- [ ] Configure state persistence for change detection
- [ ] Set up AI Maestro notifications for detected changes
- [ ] Monitor for stale items (no movement in 24+ hours)
- [ ] Alert on blocked items without resolution progress
- [ ] Track due date proximity (warn at 24h, 48h, 1 week)
