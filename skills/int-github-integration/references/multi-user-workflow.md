## Overview

### Why Multiple Identities?

Multiple GitHub identities are needed when:

1. **Owner/Developer Separation**: The repository owner reviews and approves PRs, while a separate developer account submits PRs
2. **Agent Orchestration**: An orchestrating agent uses one identity to assign and review, while worker agents use separate identities to develop
3. **Personal/Work Separation**: Different identities for personal projects vs. organizational work
4. **Formal PR Workflow**: GitHub requires different users for formal PR approval (you cannot approve your own PR)

### Identity Components

Each GitHub identity consists of:
- **GitHub Account**: Username and associated email
- **SSH Key**: Dedicated key pair for authentication
- **Git Identity**: `user.name` and `user.email` for commits
- **gh CLI Authentication**: Token stored in keyring

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate SSH Key for Secondary Account

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_secondary -C "secondary@example.com" -N ""
```

### 2. Add Key to GitHub

Copy the public key and add to your secondary GitHub account under Settings → SSH and GPG keys:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_secondary.pub
```

### 3. Configure SSH Host Alias

Add to `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host github-secondary
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_secondary
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

### 4. Authenticate Secondary Account with gh CLI

```bash
gh auth login  # Log in as secondary account in browser
gh auth status  # Verify both accounts shown
```

### 5. Configure Repository for Secondary Identity

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
git config user.name "secondary-user"
git config user.email "secondary@example.com"
git remote set-url origin git@github-secondary:owner/repo.git
```
