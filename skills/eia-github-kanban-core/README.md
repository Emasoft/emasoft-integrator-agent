# GitHub Kanban Core

**THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Atlas orchestration.**

## Overview

This skill establishes GitHub Projects V2 Kanban as the absolute center of Atlas orchestration. All planning, tracking, assignment, and completion verification flows through the Kanban board.

**The Iron Rule:** If it's not on the board, it doesn't exist. If the board says "In Progress", it IS in progress.

## Key Principles

1. **Every module = 1 GitHub Issue** on the board
2. **Every agent assignment = 1 Issue assignee**
3. **Every status change = 1 board column move**
4. **The orchestrator NEVER tracks work outside the board**

## Scripts

### kanban_get_board_state.py

Get complete board state with all items grouped by status column.

```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_get_board_state.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER [--json] [--summary]
```

### kanban_move_card.py

Move a card to a different status column with validation.

```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_move_card.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER ISSUE_NUMBER NEW_STATUS [--reason "Reason"]
```

### kanban_check_completion.py

Check if all board items are complete (for stop hook).

```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_check_completion.py OWNER REPO PROJECT_NUMBER [--verbose] [--json]
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0`: All items Done (can exit)
- `1`: Items still in progress (cannot exit)
- `2`: Blocked items exist (needs attention)

## Board Columns

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Not yet scheduled |
| **Todo** | Ready to start |
| **In Progress** | Active development |
| **In Review** | PR awaiting review |
| **Done** | Completed and merged |
| **Blocked** | Cannot proceed |

## Integration Points

- **Planning phase:** Creates issues on board
- **Orchestration phase:** Moves cards between columns
- **Stop hook:** Checks board state before exit
- **Module assignment:** Uses issue assignees
- **PR completion:** Auto-moves to Done on merge
