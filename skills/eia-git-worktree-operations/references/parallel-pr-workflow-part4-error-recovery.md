## 2.7 Error Recovery When Isolation is Violated

### Detecting Violations

Run the isolation verification script:
```bash
python scripts/eia_verify_worktree_isolation.py \
    --worktree-path /tmp/worktrees/pr-123 \
    --main-repo /path/to/main-repo \
    --check-git-status
```

### Recovery Procedure for Main Repo Contamination

If files were accidentally written to the main repo:

**Step 1: Identify contaminated files**
```bash
cd /path/to/main-repo
git status
# Shows unexpected changes
```

**Step 2: Determine if changes should be kept**
```bash
git diff <file>
# Review the changes
```

**Step 3a: Discard contaminating changes**
```bash
git checkout -- <file>
# Or for all changes:
git checkout -- .
```

**Step 3b: Move changes to correct worktree**
```bash
# Save the diff
git diff <file> > /tmp/changes.patch

# Discard in main repo
git checkout -- <file>

# Apply in correct worktree
cd /tmp/worktrees/pr-123
git apply /tmp/changes.patch
```

### Recovery Procedure for Cross-Worktree Contamination

If Agent A accidentally modified Agent B's worktree:

**Step 1: Identify which worktree was contaminated**
```bash
# Check each worktree
for wt in /tmp/worktrees/pr-*/; do
    echo "=== $wt ==="
    git -C "$wt" status
done
```

**Step 2: Determine ownership of changes**
- Which agent should have made this change?
- Is the change correct but misplaced?

**Step 3: Reset contaminated worktree**
```bash
cd /tmp/worktrees/pr-456  # Contaminated worktree
git status
git checkout -- <accidentally_modified_files>
```

**Step 4: Re-apply changes in correct worktree**
Have the correct agent redo their work in the proper worktree.

### Preventing Future Violations

After recovering from a violation:

1. **Review agent instructions:** Were isolation rules clear?
2. **Add path validation:** Implement automated checks
3. **Update prompts:** Make worktree constraints more explicit
4. **Consider file watchers:** Monitor for out-of-worktree writes

## Summary

Parallel PR workflow with worktrees requires:

1. **Proper setup:** Create worktrees with consistent naming
2. **Strict isolation:** All operations within assigned worktree
3. **Clear delegation:** Agents know their boundaries
4. **Serialized git ops:** One git operation at a time
5. **Violation recovery:** Procedures for when things go wrong
