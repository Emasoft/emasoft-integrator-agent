## Overview

Worktree verification ensures:

1. **Clean state:** No uncommitted changes before cleanup
2. **Isolation:** No files written outside worktree
3. **Branch integrity:** Branch properly merged or handled
4. **Remote sync:** All commits pushed
5. **Documentation:** Violations properly reported

Use the automated verification scripts when available, fall back to manual verification when necessary, and always document any violations found.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Check worktree status
git -C /tmp/worktrees/pr-123 status --porcelain

# Check for unpushed commits
git -C /tmp/worktrees/pr-123 log @{u}..HEAD --oneline

# Check main repo for unexpected changes
git -C /path/to/main-repo status --porcelain

# Verify isolation with script
python scripts/eia_verify_worktree_isolation.py \
    --worktree-path /tmp/worktrees/pr-123 \
    --main-repo /path/to/main-repo
```

### Verification Decision Tree

```
Before removing worktree:
├─► Is working tree clean?
│   └─► NO: Commit or stash changes first
├─► Are all commits pushed?
│   └─► NO: Push to remote first
├─► Is branch merged or intentionally abandoned?
│   └─► NO: Verify with user before removal
└─► Were any files written outside worktree?
    └─► YES: Document violation and fix first
```
