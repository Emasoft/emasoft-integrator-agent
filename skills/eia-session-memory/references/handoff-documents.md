## When to Create Handoff Documents

Create handoff documents in these situations:

| Situation | Handoff Type | File |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| Session ending mid-review | Current work state | `current.md` |
| Integration work incomplete | Integration handoff | `current.md` |
| Context compaction approaching | Preemptive handoff | `current.md` |
| Delegating to another agent | Cross-agent handoff | `current.md` + issue comment |

**DO NOT create handoff if:**
- Work is 100% complete
- All state is already in PR/issue comments
- No continuation needed

## Handoff Document Format

All handoff documents follow this template:

```markdown
# [Handoff Title]

**Session**: [Session ID or agent name]
**Created By**: EIA [agent role]

- [x] Completed action 2
- [ ] In progress: action 3 (50% done)
- [ ] Pending: action 4

- [ ] File written and readable
- [ ] If urgent, issue comment posted with handoff link

## Handoff File Locations

| File | Purpose | Retention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `current.md` | Active work state | 30 days after completion |
| `patterns-learned.md` | Accumulated patterns | Indefinite |
| `release-history.md` | Release log | 1 year |
| `ci-states.md` | CI/CD states | Until resolved |

**Base Path**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/`

## Cross-Agent Handoff

When handing off to another agent (e.g., Orchestrator, Architect):

1. Write detailed `current.md` handoff
2. Post comment on related issue:
   ```markdown
   @[agent-name] - EIA handoff available

   **Task**: [One-line task description]
   **Status**: [Progress percentage]
   **Handoff**: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/current.md`
   **Blockers**: [List blockers]

   Please continue from where I left off. All context is in the handoff document.
   ```
3. If using AI Maestro messaging, send message to target agent:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "$AIMAESTRO_API/api/messages" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "to": "target-agent-session",
       "subject": "EIA Integration Handoff",
       "priority": "high",
       "content": {
         "type": "handoff",
         "message": "Integration work requires continuation. Handoff at thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/current.md"
       }
     }'
   ```

## Reading Handoffs (Next Session)

When you receive a handoff:

1. Load handoff document:
   ```bash
   cat "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/current.md"
   ```

2. Verify freshness:
   ```bash
   stat -f "%Sm" "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/current.md"
   ```

3. Check if links still valid:
   ```bash
   # Verify PR still open
   gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json state -q .state
   ```

4. Continue from "Next Steps" section

5. Update handoff as you make progress

## Archiving Completed Handoffs

When work is complete, archive the handoff:

```bash
# Move to archive subdirectory
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/archive"
mv "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/current.md" \
   "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[task-name].md"
```

**Retention**: Archive files are kept for 90 days, then deleted.
