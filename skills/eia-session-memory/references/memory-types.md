# Memory Types

## PR Review States

**What to Remember**:
- Review status (not started, in progress, changes requested, approved)
- Feedback already given (avoid repeating comments)
- Code patterns observed (good and bad)
- Suggested changes and their rationale
- Approval blockers

**Storage**: GitHub PR comment with `<!-- EIA-SESSION-STATE -->` marker

**Example**:
```json
{
  "pr": 123,
  "status": "review_in_progress",
  "round": 2,
  "patterns_observed": ["error_handling_missing", "test_coverage_low"],
  "blockers": [],
  "timestamp": "2025-02-04T15:42:00Z"
}
```

## Code Patterns Observed

**What to Remember**:
- Recurring code quality issues (e.g., missing error handling)
- Good patterns worth reusing (e.g., clean interface design)
- Anti-patterns to flag in future reviews

**Storage**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/patterns-learned.md`

**Format**: Markdown table with pattern name, description, example, frequency

## Integration Issues Encountered

**What to Remember**:
- Merge conflicts resolved and resolution approach
- CI failures diagnosed (cause, fix, prevention)
- Dependency conflicts and solutions
- Build errors and workarounds

**Storage**: GitHub issue comments or handoff documents

## Release History and Rollbacks

**What to Remember**:
- Version numbers and release dates
- Deployment targets (staging, production)
- Approval rationale (why release was greenlit)
- Rollback decisions (why, when, how)
- Post-release issues

**Storage**: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/thoughts/shared/handoffs/eia-integration/release-history.md`

**Format**: Markdown table with columns: Version | Date | Target | Status | Notes

## CI/CD Pipeline States

**What to Remember**:
- Workflow success/failure patterns
- Flaky tests identified
- Pipeline configuration changes
- Quality gate pass rates

**Storage**: Issue comments linked to workflow runs, or handoff documents

**Example**:
```markdown
## CI State - 2025-02-04

**Workflow**: test-suite
**Run**: https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/12345
**Status**: Failed
**Cause**: Flaky test in test_integration.py::test_api_timeout
**Action**: Disabled test temporarily, created issue #456
```

## When to Remember What

| Trigger | Memory Type to Load |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Continue PR review" | PR review state |
| "Resume integration work" | Integration issues |
| "Check release history" | Release history |
| "Why did CI fail last time?" | CI/CD pipeline states |
| "Have we seen this pattern before?" | Code patterns observed |
