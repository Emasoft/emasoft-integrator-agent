# TDD Enforcement Skill

## Overview

This skill enforces Test-Driven Development (TDD) discipline through the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. It implements the Iron Law: **no production code can be written without a failing test that justifies its existence**.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of TDD principles and RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- Test framework for the target language (pytest, Jest, cargo test, etc.)
- Version control (Git) for tracking TDD commits
- AI Maestro for delegating to Remote Developer Agents

## Instructions

1. **Write a failing test (RED)** - Create a test that documents the intended behavior. Run it to confirm it fails.
2. **Make the test pass (GREEN)** - Write the minimum code needed to make the test pass. Run all tests to confirm.
3. **Refactor the code (REFACTOR)** - Improve code quality while keeping all tests passing. Run tests after each refactoring step.
4. **Commit after each phase** - Use git commits with RED:/GREEN:/REFACTOR: prefixes to track progress.
5. **Return to RED for next feature** - After completing one cycle, start the next feature with a new failing test.

**Critical Rule**: Never write production code without a failing test first.

## Output

| Output Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| TDD Status Report | Current phase status (`pending`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `refactor`) for each feature being developed |
| Git Commit Messages | Structured commits following pattern: `RED: test for [feature]`, `GREEN: implement [feature]`, `REFACTOR: improve [aspect]` |
| Test Execution Results | Pass/fail status of test suites after each phase transition |
| Enforcement Decisions | Allow/deny decisions for code changes based on TDD compliance (tests must exist before code) |
| Phase Transition Validation | Verification reports confirming proper RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle progression |
| Violation Reports | Documentation of TDD discipline violations with recovery procedures |
| Progress Tracking Updates | Multi-feature TDD cycle tracking with phase completion status |

### The Coordinator's Role

**This skill enforces TDD discipline on remote agents. The coordinator delegates testing and coding to developer agents — it verifies compliance, not performs implementation.**

**Coordinator Responsibilities:**
- **VERIFY** remote agents follow TDD (tests before code)
- **REVIEW** PRs to ensure TDD was followed
- **REJECT** work that violates TDD principles
- **DELEGATE** all test writing and code implementation to Remote Developer Agents via AI Maestro

### The TDD Cycle

TDD operates through three phases in strict order:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that documents intended behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while maintaining behavior

After completing one cycle, return to RED for the next feature.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

**Before Writing ANY Production Code:**
- [ ] A failing test exists for this specific behavior
- [ ] The test has been run and actually fails
- [ ] The failure message is clear and measurable
- [ ] The test is committed with "RED: ..." message
- [ ] Status is marked as `RED`

**TDD Cycle Summary:**
1. **RED**: Write failing test → Commit → Mark as RED
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code → All tests pass → Commit → Mark as GREEN
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code → Tests still pass → Commit → Mark as REFACTOR
4. **Repeat**: Return to RED for next feature

**Git Commit Pattern:**
```
RED: test for [feature]
GREEN: implement [feature]
REFACTOR: improve [aspect] in [feature]
```

**Status States:**
- `pending` → Test being written
- `RED` → Test fails, needs implementation
- `GREEN` → Test passes, implementation complete
- `refactor` → Code improved, ready for next cycle

**Enforcing TDD on Remote Agents?**

1. Read [Enforcement Role](references/iron-law.md#enforcement-role) - understand coordinator vs. agent responsibilities
2. Review [Phase Transition Rules](references/status-tracking.md#phase-transition-rules) - verify agent work
3. Use [Violation Recovery Procedure](references/rules-and-constraints.md#violation-recovery-procedure) - handle violations

---

## Summary

TDD Enforcement ensures quality through discipline:

- **Tests document behavior** - Every test is executable specification
- **Tests drive design** - Write test first, code second
- **Tests enable refactoring** - Change code confidently
- **Tests prevent regressions** - Old features keep working

**The Iron Law is absolute:** No code without a failing test.

**This skill enforces discipline**, remote agents execute the work.

Follow the cycle: **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → Repeat**

## RULE 14: User Requirements Are Immutable

### TDD and Requirement Compliance

TDD enforcement MUST align with RULE 14:

1. **Tests Must Match Requirements**
   - Tests verify user-specified behavior
   - Tests use user-specified technologies
   - Tests validate requirement compliance

2. **Forbidden TDD Pivots**
   - ❌ "Requirement too complex, testing simpler version"
   - ❌ "Technology X hard to test, using Y instead"
   - ❌ "Skipping test for user-requested feature"

3. **Correct TDD Approach**
   - ✅ Test exactly what user specified
   - ✅ If feature hard to test, escalate (don't skip)
   - ✅ Tests trace to specific requirements

### Test-Requirement Traceability

Every test file SHOULD include:

```python
# Tests for REQ-003: "User specified exact output format"
def test_output_format_matches_requirement():
    # Verifies: REQ-003
    ...
```

### When Tests Reveal Requirement Issues

If writing tests reveals a requirement problem:
1. STOP test writing
2. Document the issue
3. Generate Requirement Issue Report
4. WAIT for user decision
5. Resume with user's chosen direction

### TDD Phase Requirement Checks

| TDD Phase | Requirement Check |
|-----------|-------------------|
| RED | Is this testing what user actually asked for? |
| GREEN | Does implementation match user's specification? |
| REFACTOR | Does refactoring preserve user's requirements? |

## Examples

### Example 1: TDD Cycle for New Feature

```bash
# Phase 1: RED - Write failing test
git add tests/test_user_auth.py
git commit -m "RED: test for user authentication"
# Run tests - should FAIL

# Phase 2: GREEN - Implement minimum code
git add src/auth.py
git commit -m "GREEN: implement user authentication"
# Run tests - should PASS

# Phase 3: REFACTOR - Improve code quality
git add src/auth.py
git commit -m "REFACTOR: extract password validation to separate function"
# Run tests - should still PASS
```

### Example 2: Verify TDD Compliance in PR

```bash
# Check commit history follows TDD pattern
git log --oneline | grep -E "^[a-f0-9]+ (RED|GREEN|REFACTOR):"

# Expected output:
# abc1234 REFACTOR: improve error messages
# def5678 GREEN: implement login endpoint
# 789abcd RED: test for login endpoint
```

## Error Handling

### Issue: Test passes on first run (RED phase failed)

**Cause**: Test is not testing the right thing or code already exists.

**Solution**: Ensure the test fails before writing implementation. If test passes immediately, either the test is wrong or you're not in a true RED state.

### Issue: Production code written without failing test

**Cause**: TDD discipline violation.

**Solution**: Revert the production code, write the failing test first, then reimplement. Use the Violation Recovery Procedure in [references/rules-and-constraints.md](references/rules-and-constraints.md).

### Issue: Refactoring breaks tests

**Cause**: Behavior changed during refactoring.

**Solution**: Refactoring must preserve behavior. Revert to GREEN state and try smaller refactoring steps.
