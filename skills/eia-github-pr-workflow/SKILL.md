# Orchestrator PR Workflow Skill

## Overview

This skill defines the coordination workflow for Pull Request reviews. The approach is **coordination-only**: monitor PR status, delegate review tasks to specialized subagents, track completion, and report results.

**Core Principle**: This workflow separates coordination from work. The coordinator delegates, monitors, and reports — it does not perform direct review work.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Python 3.8+ for running automation scripts
- AI Maestro configured for inter-agent communication
- Access to spawn subagents for delegation

## Output

| Output Type | Format | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Subagent Delegation | Task spawn | Spawned subagent with PR review/fix instructions |
| Status Report | Text/JSON | Current PR status and action recommendations |
| Verification Result | JSON | Pass/fail status for all completion criteria |
| User Notification | Text | Human-readable summary of PR readiness |
| Polling Schedule | Background task | Recurring PR status checks |

## Instructions

1. **Poll for PRs requiring attention** - Run `eia_orchestrator_pr_poll.py` to get list of open PRs and their status
2. **Identify PR author type** - Determine if PR is from human contributor or AI/bot (see section 5)
3. **Classify work needed** - Review PR status and determine action type (review/changes/verification/wait)
4. **Delegate to appropriate subagent** - Spawn specialized subagent based on work type (never do the work yourself)
5. **Monitor subagent progress** - Use polling to track completion (never block waiting)
6. **Verify completion criteria** - Run `eia_verify_pr_completion.py` before reporting ready
7. **Report to user** - Provide status update and await merge decision (never merge without approval)
8. **Handle failures** - If verification fails, identify gaps and delegate fixes (see section 6.2)

### Checklist

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

- [ ] Poll for PRs requiring attention using `eia_orchestrator_pr_poll.py`
- [ ] Identify if PR is from human or AI/bot author
- [ ] Classify the work needed (review/changes/verification/wait)
- [ ] Delegate to appropriate subagent (never do work yourself)
- [ ] Monitor subagent progress via polling (never block)
- [ ] Verify all completion criteria using `eia_verify_pr_completion.py`
- [ ] Report status to user and await merge decision
- [ ] Handle any failures by delegating fixes

Follow the decision tree below to determine the appropriate action for any PR review request.

## Quick Reference: Decision Tree

```
PR Review Request Received
│
├─► Is PR from human or AI agent?
│   ├─► Human PR → Escalate to user for guidance
│   └─► AI/Bot PR → Direct delegation allowed
│
├─► What type of work is needed?
│   ├─► Code review → Delegate to review subagent
│   ├─► Code changes → Delegate to implementation subagent
│   ├─► CI verification → Delegate to CI monitor subagent
│   └─► Status check → Use polling script directly
│
├─► Should I block waiting?
│   └─► NEVER block. Always use background tasks or polling.
│
└─► Is PR ready to merge?
    ├─► Run completion verification script
    ├─► All criteria pass → Report to user, await merge decision
    └─► Criteria fail → Identify gaps, delegate fixes
```

## Critical Rules Summary

### Rule 1: Never Block
This workflow must NEVER execute blocking operations. All long-running tasks must be:
- Delegated to subagents
- Run as background tasks
- Monitored via polling

### Rule 2: Never Write Code
The coordinator role is to coordinate, not to implement. Code writing is ALWAYS delegated to implementation subagents.

### Rule 3: Never Merge Without User
The coordinator may verify merge readiness but NEVER executes merge without explicit user approval.

### Rule 4: Always Verify Before Reporting
Before reporting any status (ready, complete, blocked), always run the verification script to confirm.

### Rule 5: Human PRs Require Escalation
PRs from human contributors require different handling. Always escalate to user for guidance on communication and decisions.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard PR Review Coordination

```bash
# Poll for open PRs requiring action
python scripts/eia_orchestrator_pr_poll.py --repo owner/repo

# For each PR needing review, delegate to review subagent
# (orchestrator spawns subagent with appropriate prompt)

# Verify completion before reporting
python scripts/eia_verify_pr_completion.py --repo owner/repo --pr 123
```

### Example 2: Verify PR is Ready to Merge

```bash
python scripts/eia_verify_pr_completion.py --repo owner/repo --pr 123
# If complete: true, report to user for merge decision
# If complete: false, identify failing_criteria and delegate fixes
```

## Error Handling

### Issue: Subagent not returning results
**Cause**: Subagent may have crashed or become unresponsive
**Solution**: Check subagent logs, re-delegate with simpler scope

### Issue: PR status appears stale
**Cause**: GitHub API rate limiting or cache
**Solution**: Wait briefly, then re-poll. If persistent, check API rate limits.

### Issue: Completion verification fails intermittently
**Cause**: Race condition with GitHub webhook processing
**Solution**: Implement quiet period check before final verification

### Issue: Multiple subagents conflicting
**Cause**: Insufficient task isolation
**Solution**: Use worktrees for parallel work, enforce file-level isolation

### Issue: User not receiving status updates
**Cause**: Notification not triggered
**Solution**: Check notification triggers in polling schedule, ensure report step executes
